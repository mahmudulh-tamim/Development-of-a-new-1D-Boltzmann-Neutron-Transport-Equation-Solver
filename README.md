# Development-of-a-new-1D-Boltzmann-Neutron-Transport-Equation-Solver
This project is still in its nascent phase. As a matter of fact, my goal is to develop a 2D transport solver for my undergraduate thesis project using C++. For now, just to avoid too much technicalities, I have implemented the codes in matlab. Later, I will convert each code to a C++ equivalent. Furthermore, I haven't optimized the codes yet. Just tested the benchmarks and that's all.
